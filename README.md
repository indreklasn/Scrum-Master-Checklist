# Scrum-Master-Checklist


## End of spring 

- [ ] Working product
- [ ] Git tag version
- [ ] No old feature branches

## Planning

### Before starting
- [ ] Organized and prioritized Backlog by product manager
- [ ] Clear design for every user story
- [ ] Capacity for each team member
- [ ] Defined API for any 3rd-party we are going to use
- [ ] Product manager or his representative must be preset 
- [ ] No cellphones during planning
- [ ] Fixed day and time

### Planning itself
- [ ] Going through the stories by prioritization
- [ ] Break story to tasks
- [ ] Estimate each task
- [ ] Estimations need to include - Docs, manual tests, auto-tests, code-review and fixes, mock for external APIs
- [ ] Research tasks must be a part of a user story
 
## Sprint retro

- [ ] Before sprint planning
- [ ] Discus tasks that missed the estimation
- [ ] Discus Technical and architectural issues that came up
- [ ] Get retro tasks and place them in the Backlog

## During sprint

- [ ] Instead of asking questions - request to expand a doc
- [ ] No Scrum-master, every spring assign someone else 

### Stand-ups
- [ ] Locked laptops
- [ ] No cellphones
- [ ] In front of the scrum board 
- [ ] Defined maximum time for each person
 
 
### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Manual functional test
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] What can be open sourced (anything that is different from standard like Meteor Guide)
