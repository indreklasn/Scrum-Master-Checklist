### Planning itself
- [ ] Going through the stories by prioritization
- [ ] Break story to tasks
- [ ] Estimate each task
- [ ] Estimations need to include - Docs, manual tests, auto-tests, code-review and fixes, mock for external APIs
- [ ] Research tasks must be a part of a user story
 
## Sprint retro

- [ ] Before spring planning
- [ ] Discus tasks that missed the estimation
- [ ] Discus Technical and architectural issues that came up
- [ ] Get retro tasks and place them in the Backlog

## During sprint

- [ ] No Scrum-master, every spring assign someone else 

### Stand-ups
